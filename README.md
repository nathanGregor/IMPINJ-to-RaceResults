IMPINJ-to-RaceResults

Im in need of help to continue the build of this C# console application. Its intention is to read from an IMPINJ 420 speedway RFID Decoder and pass the reads to RaceResults. 

All the coding and SDK is on the web for everyone to use. I just dont have the expertise to build the solution myself.
